# Binary-Search-Tree
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++ that supports essential operations such as:

Insertion of nodes using recursion
Searching both recursively and iteratively
Deletion of nodes with all possible cases handled 
Height calculation of the tree
Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal (level-order)
Finding minimum and maximum values
